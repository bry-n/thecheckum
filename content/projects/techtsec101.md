## Welcome

Welcome to my collection of resources for those who are curious about getting into Security and Technology. Maybe you're curious about changing careers and you don't know where to start or you know someone who is. This is an ever changing list of resources to help guide you. 

## A Few Tips:

- Black Hills Information Security has a very established online community. Start here and connect with others interested in getting into any Security related field https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/. Don't forget to checkout their discord channel

- Sans Virtual Summits are free. Usually 2-day virtual events.

- Most learning platforms offer free content. You don't have to pay to play

- Try to find a mentor if possible.

- Get your hands on as much technology as possible. Understanding how a firewall, router, or a web application works will boost your defensive and offensive skills. 

- Find a FREE CTF to participate in.

- Joining a local Security group such as a local DEFCON Group. https://forum.defcon.org/social-groups

- Build a local lab. Most virtualization software is free. You can run a virtual lab on a single computer. ESXi, Proxmox, Virtualbox, Vmware workstation player, or QEMU are all free.
