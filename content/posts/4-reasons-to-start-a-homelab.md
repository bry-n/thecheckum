## What is a Homelab?

A homelab is a safe environment at home for learning about technology and security concepts. It can be as simple as a single laptop or as complex as several servers, routers, switches, and storage devices. A homelab gives you the freedom to build whatever you want. Unlike a real business network where there can be significant repercussions for breaking something, there's no issue if you break something in your own homelab. It's yours to build and learn from as you desire..
## Reason 1: Fun

Starting a homelab can be a creative outlet and a fulfilling journey. A homelab is never finished. No matter how small or how big, there's always something to improve upon. It's the feeling of knowing you planned, designed, built, updated, redesigned, rebuilt, and so on. I enjoy building things with computers. It doesn't matter if it's software-focused or hardware-focused. There's a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when a project is completed. I'm always making small improvements, and all the while, I know it's all mine to do whatever I want with.
## Reason 2: Experimentation

A homelab is a great place to perform experiments and testing. Having a homelab will give you opportunities to experiment with new technologies, test configurations, and simulate various scenarios. All of this can be done without impacting your production or non-homelab network. Personally, I keep my homelab services separate from my non-homelab services. However, there's always a risk of making a mistake and breaking something! Mistakes are often where I learn the most.

## Reason 3: Data

Take back control of your personal data by self-hosting the services you use. When you use a third-party service like Google Drive or Apple iCloud, you give up some control over the data stored with these companies. You're trusting that these massive billion-dollar companies will honor an agreement to not abuse the trust you've placed in them. The reality is, in exchange for free cloud storage, you're giving up control of your data. There's nothing stopping Apple and Google from scanning your uploaded photos for training their AI photo tools. They retain the right to modify the EULA agreement whenever they want. Like many others, I started building out my homelab to slowly regain control of my data.

## Reason 4: Skill Development

A homelab is the perfect place to learn new technologies. It's where you can develop practical skills such as networking, virtualization, system administration, automation, and security. Any new technology or skill learned in a homelab can easily be applied to your job or career. Just having a homelab can give you an edge over other applicants. It shows you have a desire to learn and are self-motivated when it comes to starting and completing projects. Practical skill development and technology exposure are the main reasons I started a homelab.

## Recommendations For Getting Started

- Start small and spend as little money as possible when getting started.
- Focus on areas of interest.
- Search for used gear online.
- Ask friends and family if they have old computers they don't need anymore.
- Research, research, research! There are lots of resources to help guide you. 
- Learn to automate tasks for your homelabâ€™s management.
- Continue to update and improve your homelab as you learn and grow.

Here's a few of my favorite resources.

## Final Thoughts

A homelab is where we can build whatever we want. My homelab is where I build and break things. I develop new skills and learn about new technologies. It's where I slowly regain control over my data.

So, I challenge you to start small and have fun!
