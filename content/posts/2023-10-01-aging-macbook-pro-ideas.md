## Intro

I have a 2015 MacBook Pro which used to be my primary laptop.  I've replaced it with an HP 865 G9 laptop running Linux.  I'll go into details about this change sometime in the future. Right now I thought it would be fun to brainstorm what to do with an older Apple laptop.

So what to do with this laptop?  It's been a solid computer since the day I bought it. As much as I love this laptop, it was starting to show it's age.  In an effort to keep it feeling fresh I paid Apple ~ $600 US Dollars to replace the battery, screen, and a dying fan.  However, unfortunately for me Apple dropped my model from newer venison of macOS starting with Ventura.  Basically, the last version of macOS supported by my 2015 Macbook Pro is Monterey.  Of course I'll receive Monterey updates but I won't get those new goodies released in newer versions of macOS.

So what can we do with this laptop?  Here's a few ideas if we can use the laptop for until Apple drops all support for macOS Monterey.

- Keep it charged and ready to use if we have purchased any macOS specific software.  Personally, I bought some photo editing software for the mac.  In my case I could use it as a photo editing workstation.  

- Use the laptop for online test taking with certifications.  Some of the certifications I have allow for online proctoring.  I could solely use the laptop for online proctoring.  The online proctoring software can be very anti-privacy.  When installed it monitors the entire laptop to make sure you are not cheating during the exam.  

- Donate the laptop to a family member.  

- I could try selling it on the cheap.

What should we do when Apple drops all support for Monterey?

- We can install....LINUX!!  Apple makes fantastic hardware.  Linux runs amazing on older hardware.  

- Convert the laptop into a server using Linux.  Laptops make fantastic servers.  The battery acts like a builtin uninterruptible power supply (UPS).    

- I could still try to sell the laptop.  Maybe I could convince someone to trade it for a sandwich.
## Conclusion

So what will I end up doing with this laptop?  Spoiler alert...I'll most likely turn it into a server. Did I waste my money by paying Apple to fix a few hardware issues before getting it dropped from future macOS versions?  I don't think so.  The hardware will most likely run for years.  I'll breath new life into the laptop with Linux.
